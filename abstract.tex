We present an approach to introduce visual information in the walking pattern generator for humanoid robots. We make use of visual servoing with model predictive control (MPC), which is joined to the walking motion generator. Since visual servoing with MPC is a nonlinear optimization problem, we propose a linearization scheme in order to keep it as a Quadratic Program (QP) and introduce it within the pattern generator. However, the trajectories realized by the robot are generated by only minimizing the distance in the image feature space and might create unnecessary motion in the space of the footprints. We worked in solving this problem by making the CoM follow a convenient space of trajectories for which the overall behavior of the robot is better.
